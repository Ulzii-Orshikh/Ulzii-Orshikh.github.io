# Music-Memory
This is a well-known memory game, but with some twist. As almost every music pitch perception tests available are super boring, I assembled this game to make it more interesting. 
I have used code written by Sandra Israel-Ovirih and contributed by Pradeep Singh. Additionally, I used Tone.js to generate audios.
